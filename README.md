==========
Hello everyone! This my university project for the course 'Programing with Ruby' In the following days the game will be under heavy development so stay tuned.

How to run the game under Linux
----------

* You need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed (2.1.0 is recomended)
* After you've installed ruby you will to install ``libncursesw5-dev``

> **Ubuntu:** ``sudo apt-get intsall libncursesw5-dev`` *(This will allow ``curses`` to run with unicode characters)*

* Now install the ``curses`` gem

> **Ubuntu:** ``gem install curses``

* Clone this repository somewhere on your computer, open a terminal and move to the destination folder
